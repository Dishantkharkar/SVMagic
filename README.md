# SVMagic: Support Vector Machines Repository

Welcome to SVMagic, your repository for exploring, understanding, and implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms! Here, you'll find a collection of personal projects, mathematical insights, and code implementations related to SVMs.

## About Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes, maximizing the margin between classes. SVMs are widely used in various fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, and bioinformatics.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:

- **Mathematics Behind SVMs**: Detailed explanations of the mathematical concepts and principles behind SVM algorithms.
- **Personal Projects**: Practical applications and projects utilizing SVMs for classification and regression tasks.
